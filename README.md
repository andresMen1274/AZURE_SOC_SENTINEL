# AZURE_SOC_SENTINEL
This project demonstrates how to build a fully functional home Security Operations Center (SOC) in the cloud using Microsoft Azure. The goal of this lab is to simulate a real-world enterprise security environment where logs are collected, analyzed, and visualized to detect and respond to attacks.

To start the project first I will navigate to the Microsoft Azure page and create a free AZURE account. After this is done we will create a resource group and this is done by searching resource groups and then selectuing create. For this lab I am using the free subscription and the resource group name is RG-SOC-LAB.

This is the folder in the cloud that will contain the contents of the lab. Next we will create a virtual network that the virtual machine will connect to. When creating this network we want to make sure that resource group is set to the newly created one.
